Usage: upshot init

Initializes Upshot, downloading the necessary files to the local filesystem.

As part of the initialization process, `upshot init` will ask for your GitHub
username and password. If you choose to create a new Gist, these credentials
will be used to create a new Secret Gist on your behalf. Otherwise, these
credentials will allow Upshot to ask you which Gist you would like to use. This
Gist is used to store the Upshot.
