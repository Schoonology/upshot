Usage: upshot open

If piped into a command, `upshot open` sends the location of the Upshot file to
stdout. Otherwise, `upshot open` attempts to open the Upshot file in the
preferred editor. If an "editor" is set in ~/.upshotrc, that command will be
used. Otherwise, the system-wide default for Markdown will be used instead.

Examples:

  upshot open
  upshot open | xargs -n 1 vim
